					<h1 class="font-weight-bold">V For Vendetta</h1>
					<p class="font-weight-light font-italic">V For Vendetta is a movie made in 2005 by DC Comics, starring Hugo Weaving 
					and Natalie Portman, directed by James McTeigue. The movie is basically about the 
					V and his dedication to his vengeance, or you can say goal. His goal is to get vengeance from 
					people whose responsible what he had suffer	in the past and give the people of England the freedom 
					they have been desperately seeking by taking down the tyrannical regime. The thing I like in this 
					movie, specifically, is the character of V. He is so kind, sophisticated and so dedicated 
					and those specifications of him makes you feel so many different and conflicting emotions during 
					the movie.And the love of V and Evey is so pure that can make you believe in true love again.</p>

					<h1 class="font-weight-bold text-right">Curious Case of Benjamin Button</h1>
					<p class="font-weight-light font-italic text-right">Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a movie made in 2009, directed by David Fincher and 
					starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. The storyline is loosely based on the 1922 short story 
					of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald.Benjamin has a disease, he was aging the opposite of normal people. 
					His mother died when she was giving birth to him and his father abandoned him because of the anger of his wife's 
					death and the sadness when he saw Benjamin's old, ugly face. Where he abandoned him was a nursing home and the  
					woman responsible from this place raised Benjamin. The lesson I learned and why I love this movie is because the  
					"The Ugly Duckling" like story. You shouldn't judge people by their appereances and anybody who is a ugly duckling  
					can turn into a gorgeous swan. This isn't just a basic ethical lesson, it's a very big and important metaphor if  
					you can understand. And the second thing I like in this movie is the timeless, beautiful and unsparing love among  
					Benjamin and Daisy. No matter where they go, no matter they have been through,no matter they were old or young 
					the fate and their love for each other always kept them connected. This is a kind of love that 
					everyone wants but only someone can have.</p>

					<h1 class="font-weight-bold">Life is Beautiful</h1>
					<p class="font-weight-light font-italic">This movie is an Italian movie, directed by Italian director Roberto Bengini and also starring Roberto Bengini 
					and Nicoletta Braschi. The movie is considered as a cult by most movie enthusiasts and it's about the 
					holocaust to the Jewish people during the WWII, but the movie shows us a very unexpected side of this 
					embarrasing historical event. A man, Guido strangely coincides with a beautiful teacher Dora and they 
					fell in love each other more by each occuring coincide. Finally they marry (actually Guido kidnaps 
					Dora willingly from her wedding with an another wealthy man) each other and have a little child named 
					Giosue. The crimes against Jewish people was going on already but with the beginning of the WWII, they  
					arrest all the Orefice family and sent them to a working camp. Giosue was too young to understand and be  
					able to comprehend what is really going on, so his father Guido told him that it was a vacation that you  
					can win a tank if you collect all the points and be the first one on the list. Guido dead while searching for   
					Dora when war is over but both Dora and Giosue survived from the camp and Giosue magically had a chance to get  
					in an actual tank. I must say that I laughed, cried, laughed and cried atthe same time while watching the movie 
					and I saw the cruel and worst side of the human history by watching this amazing movie.</p>

					<h1 class="font-weight-bold text-right">The Intouchables</h1>
					<p class="font-weight-light font-italic text-right">I recommended this movie to everyone I was talking about movies and haven't watched it yet. This movie is 
					a French production, directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano and it's based upon a real story. Starring
					Fran√ßois Cluzet and Omar Sy. The movie is about a wealthy man quadriplegic from a paradigling accident and 
					his friendship that is unlikely close and funny. Driss is a poor and jobless man wants to get unemployment 
					benefit. But he has to apply some jobs and get rejected to get this benefit. So he goes to the home of Philippe 
					not knowingly and all he expected from them to was to sign a piece of paper that will show he was rejected from 
					this job. But Philippe liked the Driss and the thing he liked especially is, Driss wasn't pitying him and even 
					making jokes about his situation. As time goes, they became real buddies and have really fun together and you  
					can join their fun by watching this beautiful movie. It'll worth your time, believe me!</p>
